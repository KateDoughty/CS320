## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing is the best way to ensure code quality. Putting software through vigorous testing makes sure that code not only works, but stands up to stress, such as high traffic and attacks. 
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Starting with a list of user needs and requirements is the best way to start. That way you have a physical list that you can use as a framework for the program, and you can check off requirements as you incorporate them into the code.
## How do I approach designing software?
As I said above, I start with a list of requirements that can be used as a framework to create psuedocode, which is then translated into actual code. This method is good for making sure code includes what the clients need, while also keeping my work organized.
